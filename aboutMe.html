            <p>Hello, my name is Emma Macdonald. This website is just a base example of what I can possibly achieve. It is rather simple and not complex in the slightest but I feel it sufficiently showcases a base of my skill.</p>

            <p>Now onto who I am professionally. I am an extremely hard worker who can work in both a team and by herself. If given a task and a deadline, I will try my hardest to complete it and shan't rest until I can achieve it. If I cannot achieve it by myself, then I will ask for help to obtain a quicker way of completing the task. I am organised, hard-working and professional.</p>

            <p>Whilst I have knowledge of how to create a website and how to make it look good, I am yet to obtain substatial professional experience. I do have one month of professional experience with Donohue consultancy, where I learned how to customise a CMS system called Neto.</p>
